# charactercount
The Character Counter is a simple, interactive feature designed to provide real-time feedback to users while they type in a text input or textarea. It helps users stay within predefined character limits by dynamically displaying the number of characters typed and the remaining characters allowed.

# Features:
Real-Time Updates:

As users type, the counter automatically updates to reflect the total characters entered and the remaining characters available.

Predefined Character Limit:

The feature enforces a maximum character limit (e.g., 200 characters) to maintain concise inputs.

Warning for Exceeding Limit:

If the user exceeds the character limit, typing is disabled, and a warning message is displayed to alert the user.

Dynamic User Experience:

Enhances usability by providing instant feedback without requiring page reloads.
